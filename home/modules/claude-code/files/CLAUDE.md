## Skills (auto-generated by `/sync-skills`)

When a task matches a skill below, you MUST invoke it via the Skill tool BEFORE taking any other action. Pay attention to override instructions (what NOT to do) in each entry.

- `/design-doc` — Standardized design document format with template and guidelines. Load this skill when writing or editing a design document to ensure correct structure. Teammates in agent teams must always load this skill using Skill(design-doc). Do NOT write design documents in a freeform format — always use this skill's template.
- `/design-doc-create` — Create a new design document using the design-doc-creator agent. Use when user wants to create a specification, implementation plan, or technical document. Teammates must always load skills using the Skill tool, not by reading skill files directly. Do NOT use EnterPlanMode — always invoke this skill instead.
- `/design-doc-execute` — Implement features based on a design document with automatic validation and fixing. Use when the user asks to implement or execute a design document. Takes document path as argument. Teammates must always load skills using the Skill tool, not by reading skill files directly. Do NOT implement a design document by reading it and coding manually — always invoke this skill instead.
- `/design-doc-interview` — Validate a design document through fine-grained multi-question Q&A across multiple sessions. Adds COMMENT(claude) annotations for discrepancies found. Supports multi-session splitting for large documents. Use after /design-doc-create and before /design-doc-execute. Takes document path as argument. Do NOT use this to create or execute design documents — use the dedicated skills instead.
- `/github-cli` — Use this skill when the user shares a GitHub URL (issue or pull request). Automatically fetch details using GitHub CLI (gh command). Triggered by URLs like github.com/himkt/.claude/issues/123 or github.com/himkt/.claude/pull/123. Do NOT run gh commands directly — always invoke this skill first.
- `/my-slidev` — Create Slidev presentations using the custom theme with cover, bullets, two-cols, and blank layouts. Use when generating presentations from research reports, outlines, or other content. References /slidev for syntax details.
- `/pathfinder-explain` — Explain the implementation of a symbol by tracing its definition using LSP. Use when user asks to explain, trace, or understand how a specific symbol (function, class, variable) is implemented. Takes symbol name as argument. Do NOT rely on grep and reading files alone — use this skill for accurate LSP-based tracing.
- `/research-presentation` — Create a Slidev presentation and reading transcript from an existing research report folder. Reads report.md and researcher files for context, creates slides using /my-slidev skill and a reading transcript. Takes folder path as argument (e.g., design-docs/topic-name). Do NOT use for research — use /research-report for that.
- `/research-report` — Create a comprehensive research report with folder-based output using agent teams. Researchers write findings to individual files, Manager compiles report.md, Director reviews. Output goes to design-docs/{topic-slug}/. After report approval, offers to chain into /research-presentation for slides and transcript. Teammates must always load skills using the Skill tool, not by reading skill files directly. Requires CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS enabled. Do NOT do a quick web search and summarize — invoke this skill for thorough, multi-source research.
- `/slidev` — Create and present web-based slides for developers using Markdown, Vue components, code highlighting, animations, and interactive features. Use when building technical presentations, conference talks, or teaching materials.
- `/sync-skills` — Read all skills from skills/ directory and update the Skills section in CLAUDE.md to stay in sync. Run this after adding, removing, or modifying skills.

Notes:
- Save design documents to `design-docs/{slug}/design-doc.md`
