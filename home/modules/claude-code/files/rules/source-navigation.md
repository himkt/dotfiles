# Source Navigation

- NEVER use `ls` or `tree` via Bash. These are denied in settings.json
- Use Glob tool for file/directory listing and pattern-based search
- Use Explore agent (Task tool with subagent_type=Explore) for broader codebase navigation
- Use Read tool to inspect directory contents when needed
