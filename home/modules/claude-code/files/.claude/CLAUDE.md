## Overview

This is the `~/.claude` configuration directory.
Since Claude Code treats `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` as global settings, this repository has a unique CLAUDE.md structure:

- `CLAUDE.md` (root) → Global settings for all projects
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (this file) → Settings specific to this repository

**What goes where:**
- Global: Cross-project settings, custom agent/command/skill descriptions, personal preferences
- Project: Repository structure, project-specific conventions

**Rule:** "Needed in other projects?" → Yes: global, No: project

## Project Skills (auto-generated by `/sync-skills`)

When a task matches a skill below, you MUST invoke it via the Skill tool BEFORE taking any other action. Pay attention to override instructions (what NOT to do) in each entry.

- `/review-claude-config` — Review ~/.claude configuration against the latest Claude Code features and best practices, then suggest updates.
